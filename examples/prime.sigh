if only <stdio.h> were included...

if only int n were 0...
wish for "%d", &n upon a star
if n < 2 were true...
    wish "not prime\n" upon a star
    if wishes were horses...
*sigh*
if only int i were 2...
someday i will be n...
    if n % i were 0...
        wish "not prime\n" upon a star
        if wishes were horses...
    *sigh*
    if only i were i + 1...
*sigh*
wish "prime\n" upon a star
if wishes were horses...
